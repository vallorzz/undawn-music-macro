# Undawn Music Macro (AutoHotKey)
These are AutoHotKey scripts used for playing music in the game Undawn

You need AHK v2.0 installed: https://www.autohotkey.com

You can find songs for each instrument in the folders above.

Save the code as a .ahk then double click to run. 

1. In-game, take out the required instrument.
2. Press the hotkey CTRL + 1 to being playing music. (Hotkey can be changed at top of each song code)
3. Your character will now automatically play through the entire song :)

NOTE: Timing between keys is totally off and not accurate at all, feel free to change them, it's the "Sleep" after each set of keystrokes, currently set to 300 MS for most by default.
